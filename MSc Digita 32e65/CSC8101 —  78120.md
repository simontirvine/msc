# CSC8101 — Big Data Analytics

# **Assignments**

The overall mark consists of two parts, with weights specified from the beginning here (see Assessment):  [https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/39936](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/39936) and also repeated here below:

1. **Spark programming [90% of total mark]**
Deliverables specified here:  [https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/39936/assignments/153789](https://ncl.instructure.com/courses/39936/assignments/153789) 
2. **Discussion** **[10% of total mark]** on the following two items, in the form of a recorded video of 5 minutes (recommended) and **no more than 10** -- where you may use any media support, code walk-through, slides, etc: 
    1. your own work on Spark, explaining key elements of your solution. Imagine you are trying to convince your manager that you have implemented the best and most efficient pipeline to accomplish the data engineering tasks given to you
    2. how GDSL algorithms can be used to generate useful insights into the NYC trips graph. My suggestion is to use the solutions to the Neo4J exercise to test other centrality and community algorithms, and briefly discuss their relative merits. Again, imagine you have been asked to select an analytics strategy to recommend taxi positioning to a client, and you are now discussing your solution with your manager.

### SUBMISSION

[https://adb-8319681591331291.11.azuredatabricks.net/](https://adb-8319681591331291.11.azuredatabricks.net/)
Use appropriate cluster (if possible)

Format:

- Spark - Exported HTML and ipynb (zipped)
- Discussion - Video file itself (5-10 minutes)

### What to report

You are required to submit:

1. **your notebook**
2. **a report on performance, at the bottom of the notebook itself.** Considering that the tasks form an end-to-end pipeline, please provide two comprehensive tables with end-to-end performance:
    1. 1 table for running on delta format, for all formats S,M,L,XL,XXL
    2. 1 table for running on parquet format, **limited to** formats S,M,L
    
    These tables will look like the following:
    
    | exec times | S | M | L | XL | XXL |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | time (min) |  |  |  |  |  |
    | time (sec) |  |  |  |  |  |
    | secs / 1M records |  |  |  |  |  |
    
    where the last row is simply the time normalised by number of records.
    
3. **a complete view of the final output from the pipeline.** To simplify this, *please only use your XXL results.* This will include the top 10 lists (3 of them). The entries in the list will contain the name of the zone and the corresponding metric, following these examples:
    
    **total trips:**
    
    12          Upper East Side South      5519525 88          Upper East Side North      5084773...
    
    **average_profit:**
    
    106                     Newark Airport       75.193076 105                      Arden Heights       38.119520
    
    **total_volume:** 12          Upper East Side South     8265045.0 88          Upper East Side North     7626015.0
    
    so that we can check correctness at least approximately.
    
4. **please also add as many comments and documention** into Markdown cells as you think are needed for the markers to understand the logic of your work.utl
