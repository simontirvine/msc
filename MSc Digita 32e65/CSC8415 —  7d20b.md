    - As a group, **develop, prepare and present** a business strategy for harnessing the value of digital innovation in recruitment systems and workforce management. The total length of the presentation is **20 minutes** and all members of the group must present and demonstrate a clear role within the group. The booking for your group's presentation will soon be available in Canvas via "Calendar".
    - Each member will also submit the group’s slides in **NESS** (NOT Canvas).
    
2. **Group Report [80% of total mark]**
- Your own work on Spark, explaining key elements of your solution. Imagine you are trying to convince your manager that you have implemented the best and most efficient pipeline to accomplish the data engineering tasks given to you
- How GDSL algorithms can be used to generate useful insights into the NYC trips graph. My suggestion is to use the solutions to the Neo4J exercise to test other centrality and community algorithms, and briefly discuss their relative merits. Again, imagine you have been asked to select an analytics strategy to recommend taxi positioning to a client, and you are now discussing your solution with your manager.
