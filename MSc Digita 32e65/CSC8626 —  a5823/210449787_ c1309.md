### **Visualizing Uncertainty  â€” Power BI [90% of total mark]**

1. **Part 1 : Visualizing uncertainty and impact from a single file (60%)**
Your task is to create an interactive visualization that allows a decision maker to compare different areas of the city by the impact of the outbreak and by the uncertainty of that impact. Your aim is to enable the viewer to understand the situation and then decide which areas of the city to target first with medical aid.
2. **Part 2 : Visualizing variation across multiple scenarios (30%)** 
Your task here is to demonstrate the impact and uncertainty of the scenarios across multiple simulation runs. Again, you are aiming to help the decision maker decide which areas of the city it is most important to target with aid first. But now there are up to one thousand different variations in the wind speed and direction (four per data file). You might be able to do this with your solution to part 1 but it is possible you will need an overview visualization of some kind.
