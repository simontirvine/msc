### Critical reflection

Prepare a short report via NESS (no more than two pages) summarising the work carried out, and a critical reflection on your experience using the tools and techniques introduced on this module in completing the coursework assignment. We are particularly interested in any assumptions you made about the data, and how they motivated your design decisions.
