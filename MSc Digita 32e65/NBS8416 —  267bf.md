# NBS8416 — Digital Technologies and Innovation Management

# Introduction

A little bit about this module. This is not a really formal academic module that prioritises academic approaches to things. Instead it is focused on real life applications of the concepts taught, in a relaxed atmosphere. So please be prepared to be as relaxed and normal as possible, and just talk and act like you would in every day life.

The two main teaching staff will be Thomas Webb and Felix Williams. Thomas is the CEO of a digital health consultancy, and geeks out about technology strategy. Felix is much more technical than Thomas and is an enterprise architect, but equally geeks out about tech strategy, except actually understands the tech bit.
